This is a Python script using the Pygame library to implement a simple Tic Tac Toe game with a basic AI opponent using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.

Here's a brief overview of the code:

1. **Importing Libraries:**
   - `pygame`: Library for creating games.
   - `sys`: Provides access to some variables used or maintained by the Python interpreter.
   - `random`: Library for generating random numbers.

2. **Constants and Colors:**
   - Constants like `WIDTH`, `HEIGHT`, `LINE_WIDTH`, `BOARD_SIZE`, and `SQUARE_SIZE` define the game's parameters.
   - Colors like `WHITE`, `BLACK`, `RED`, and `BLUE` are used for drawing on the screen.

3. **Pygame Initialization:**
   - Pygame is initialized, and a game window is created with the specified dimensions.

4. **Functions for Drawing:**
   - `draw_board()`: Draws the Tic Tac Toe board on the screen.
   - `draw_xo()`: Draws the Xs and Os on the board.
   - `draw_x(row, col)`: Draws an X at a specific position.
   - `draw_o(row, col)`: Draws an O at a specific position.

5. **Game Logic Functions:**
   - `check_winner(player)`: Checks if the specified player has won.
   - `is_board_full()`: Checks if the board is full.
   - `evaluate_board()`: Evaluates the current state of the board.
   - `minimax(board, depth, maximizing_player, alpha, beta)`: Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for the AI opponent.
   - `get_computer_move()`: Determines the computer's move using the minimax algorithm.

6. **Main Game Loop (`main()`):**
   - Manages the game loop, where players can make moves by clicking on the screen.
   - Checks for events such as quitting the game or player moves.
   - Updates the game state, draws the board, and displays the winner or a tie.
   - Uses the minimax algorithm to make the computer's move.

7. **Execution:**
   - The `main()` function is called when the script is executed.

Overall, this script creates a simple Tic Tac Toe game where a player can play against the computer AI. The computer uses the minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.
